Like all great ideas, Outline was conceived while reading the Declaration of Independence.

One phrase in particular stood out:

>To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

Placing your "Facts" before a "candid world." Interesting. The facts are meant to be unbiased and unassailable. Of course they are not. Like all facts, they have a viewpoint, politics.

The world is candid by being unbiased. Jefferson argues that the need for Independence is the logical outgrowth of these facts. Laid out, the world cannot help but agree. The world is not "candid" in the sense of being unbiased, just as the facts contain bias.

But how does that get us to Outline? Outline is a publication that submits facts to a candid world for consideration.

Truth be told, we wanted http://candid.world for the domain, but it was taken. The sites and publications that use the phraseology tend to be strongly conservative or libertarian. We are not.

An outline is the not the whole of an idea. It is not all the facts, stories and analysis that make up the _truth_ one might submit to a candid world. It is the essence.

Outline is the shape of our world. The contours for your consideration.
